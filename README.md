# Author_prediction
In this project I have tried to identify/classify different authors based on their stylometry features like most common words, articles, punctuations, etc. using Spacy library. The data is analyzed, preprocessed to select best features which contribute most in classification. Models which are used for meta-feature based approach are Light GBM, Na√Øve Bayes, Decision tree, Logistic Regression and XGBoost. Model used for Content based approach are Ridge Classifier, Multilayer Perceptron, KNN, Logistic Regression and Random forest
